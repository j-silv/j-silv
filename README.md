### Welcome to Justin Silver's GitHub page!

I'm passionate about electronics, programming, and learning. Here you'll find projects that I have worked on since 2018, ranging from silly bash script programs to FPGA-based Sudoku games. Feel free to check out [my personal website](http://www.justin-silver.com) for more detailed write-ups.

Thanks for visiting!
